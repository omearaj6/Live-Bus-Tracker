### Project Description (1-2 pages)

#### Description (Min 250 words)

Our 3rd-year project is a website showing a live map of buses that allows users to report when buses are running late or early, improving the accuracy of bus arrival estimates. While Dublin Bus does have GPS tracking on their buses, it’s often wildly inaccurate. By incorporating real-time user reports, the website will offer more accurate predictions of when buses are expected to arrive at each stop. User-reported delays can be shown on the map in real time.

Simplicity and ease of use are important parts of the app. We are focused on developing a user-friendly interface that allows users to quickly report late buses without navigating through complex steps or cluttered menus. This design will encourage more users to submit reports, increasing the volume of data available and further enhancing the accuracy of the website's predictions.

We will be using **Leaflet.js** and **OpenStreetMap** to create the map interface, allowing users to see buses and stops nearby. For live bus tracking, we will use the API provided by **Transport for Ireland**.

### Division Of Work

We’ll both be working together on the frontend and backend. James can create the map interface while Michael works on live tracking and user reports, but we will continuously communicate. As we progress, we will divide tasks based on each group member’s expertise.

### Programming Languages

- HTML/CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Python  

---

### Programming Tools

- ReactJS  
- Django  
- OpenStreetMap  
- Leaflet.js  
- General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Realtime TFI API

### Learning Challenges

- **Leaflet.js** and **OpenStreetMap** are new software applications for us, and learning to use their features will be a challenge.
- Real-time data processing of **GTFS Realtime** on the map, along with factoring in user reports, will also be a challenge.

### Hardware/Software Platform

The web application will be developed on Unix-based machines, and it will be important to ensure the application works on mobile devices.
